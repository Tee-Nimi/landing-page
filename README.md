# landing-page
This is me trying to create a simple landing page using css float method, flex method and possibly later grid method. The goal is to produce the landing page on https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aKfelZIybzg/maxresdefault.jpg using just HTML and a little bit of CSS.
This repo contains 4 files: landing-page.html, landing-page.css, landing-page2.html and landing-page2.css.
In landing-page.html and landing-page.css, the goal is to create the simple 'landing' page without using css flex and css grid while in landing-page2.html and landing-page2.css, the desire is to create the same page using css flex.
